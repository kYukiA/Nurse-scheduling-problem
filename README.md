# Nurse-scheduling-problem
This is a python program using vcopt. I created a program that automatically generates a work schedule. I made this program to learn python, so there may be some mistakes in it.  vcopt is a software from Vinekula (https://vigne-cla.com/).

## Objective
* Creating a work schedule is time consuming and burdensome.
* There are many restrictions and it takes time to check.
* The burden is concentrated on specific people.

I want to solve these problems.

## Requirement
### Prerequisites
Five employees.
Employees are required to submit their vacation requests for a few days before they are scheduled to work.

### Work Schedule Restrictions
Three or four people have to come to work.
I want to make sure that the number of days off that overlap with weekends and holidays are the same among employees.
I want to align the number of holidays among employees.
One of the two designated people must come to work.
